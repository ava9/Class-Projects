					"Felicia has worked with our two sons for over 10 years. She has helped them in such insurmountable ways; from teaching them their first words to then developing those words into sentences to reading comprehension and social skills and learning to interact with peers.  What I love most about Felicia is how versatile she is with both of my sons.  They are so different and she knew how to adjust her methods to make it work in an individualized way with each of them.  She is always willing to try something new with them and if it doesn't work, she changes it up. Thanks to Felicia, our boys have made incredible gains and are now mainstreamed in typical classrooms with some support.  I never want to imagine where my boys would be if we hadn't met Felicia."<br>

					"It is almost impossible to summarize in one paragraph the exceptional and life changing work of Felicia.  The quality of her work is evidenced by who our son has become today.  He is fully included in a 5th grade regular education classroom and is virtually independent and very happy."<br>

					"My son worked with Felicia since he was 2.  When he started, he really had no words and we were not sure if he would ever have any.   She used many high interest, hands-on activities to get through to my son.  She was patient and knowledgeable and gave us advice when we needed it.  She was also able to be structured with him when he needed it.  My son has made lots of progress.  He now has so much more language.  He can communicate and understand the world and is a much happier little boy.  I truly believe that Felicia was a big part in helping him at this very critical and early stage.  The insight and caring she has with him have made us truly grateful."<br>

					"My son's speech and conversational skills have blossomed under Felicia's direction.  My son always enjoyed going to "play" with Felicia.  She was able to introduce language concepts in a very playful and non-threatening manner.  Felicia was also very helpful in training the members of my son's school team."<br>
