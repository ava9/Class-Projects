					Growing Together provides both speech/language therapy and speech/language evaluations. Therapy can occur in both individual and group sessions. Therapy sessions typically are 45 minutes in length and clients are seen at a frequency of about two times weekly. The rates for therapy are as follows:<br><br> 
					30 min = $90 <br>
					45 min = $135 <br>
					60 min = $180 <br> 
					Group of 2 for 45 min = $100 <br><br>
					* Special pricing is available if necessary. Please speak to Felicia about this personally. <br><br>
					Evaluations typically consist of a video and document review, 2 hours of direct time with the client and a written report. The cost of the evaluations start at $800. If additional time is necessary, the time will be billed at the hourly rate of $180/hour. <br><br>
					Growing Together is an out-of-network provider and can provide you with invoices marked with specific codes for you to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. <br><br>
					Growing Together is contracted with the NYC Department of Education and accepts RSAs from both CPSE and CSE. <br>
