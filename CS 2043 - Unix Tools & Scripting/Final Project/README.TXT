CS 2043
Final Project

Run python script like this ./moo.py 5555 4000 4001 and ./moo.py 4444 4001 4000
Run unix script like this ./themovies.sh

Make sure you have internet access.

Assignment Review:

1) Python - tedious, spend more time teaching python scripting (file exchanging, server and client setup, networking with ports, etc).  Not everyone has taken CS 1110.
2) Unix - fair assignment
